This project provides schematics, templates and software to build an arduino driven speedometer like bandwidth meter
using cheap RC servos. Throughput bandwidth is read from a Fritz!Box router
through its upnp web server.
Materials needed:
Arduino uno (tested with version R3)
Arduino ethernet shield
Two TowerPro SG90 Micro Servos
A ten centimeter diameter tin can with its lid carefully removed
A ten centimeter diameter perspex disc.
Some jumper cables.
